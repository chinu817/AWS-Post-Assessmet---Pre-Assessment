Q2.What will be the outcome of this IAM Policy?
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [{
"Action": "ec2:*",
"Resource": "*",
"Effect": "Allow"
},
{
"Action": "*",
"Resource": "*",
"Effect": "Deny"
}
]
}

Ans.
   All users can take all actions on  ec2 and it's resources, but all users cannot access all the services and it's recources.
All users can only access ec2 and it's resources.
